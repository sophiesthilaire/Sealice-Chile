**Please Note:**

- This model predicts the likely level of adult _C. rogercressyi_ on Atlantic salmon farms in Chile that have no neighbouring farms within 10km and a maximum of two neighbours within 20 km.

- The model is only valid where the starting level of _C. rogercressyi_ is less than 1.55 adults. In addition it should only be applied when the fish are greater than 500g, the salinity is more than 25ppt and the water temperature is between 7 and 16 °C.
